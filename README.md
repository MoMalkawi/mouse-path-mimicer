# MouseRecorderRepeater

**MouseRecorderRepeater** is a tool designed to record mouse movements and then use that recorded path to move the mouse to a different point on the screen. It can be used for recording paths or for educational purposes.

## Disclaimer

1. **Code Quality**: The code is messy and was created as a personal project to experiment with. It is not polished and should be used with caution.
2. **Path Limitations**: This tool does not support playing paths longer than the recorded length. For example, if you record a path that is 500 pixels in length, you cannot replay a path that is 501 pixels long.
